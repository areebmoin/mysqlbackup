Credits:
I have been using this script for years. Credit for the original script goes to the author (bofh468) of this article: http://www.tech-recipes.com/rx/221/mysql-daily-database-dumps-all-nicely-sorted/.

What does it do?
The script will connect to a MySQL database server and backup all of the databases running on the server. Files are saved with timestamps. Once you test the script, set it up in cron or as a launch daemon for automated backups.

Setup:
1. Add MySQL server username and password in the two places of script requiring entry
2. Modify the backup path if you want backups to be stored in a specific location
3. Set the MaxFileAge to the number of days you with to keep backups
